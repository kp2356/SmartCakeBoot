Developing SmartCakeBoot is possible with the combination of CakePHP Framework (1.3) and Twitter Bootstrap (2.0).

SmartCakeBoot is smart because here you can develop STATIC WEBSITES (and dynamic too) with CakePHP Framework (1.3) and Twitter Bootstrap (2.0).

For Static Website : 
-------------------------

1) All you need is to edit app/views/pages/index.ctp
2) And, to create more pages, just create "example.ctp" file in app/views/pages


For Dynamic Website : 
-------------------------

1) All you need is just to edit your database.php
Change :

(*) 'driver' => 'mysql'
(*) and other fields like host, login, password, database.

2) and routes.php and Bake it !!!!
